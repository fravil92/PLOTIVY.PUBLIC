> **AI-assisted plotting, Design of Experiments (DOE), and scientific reporting** from simple prompts. Created by scientists, for scientists.

## 🚀 What is Plotivy?

Plotivy is an AI-powered platform that transforms raw data and micrographs into publication-ready plots, statistical metrics, and comprehensive reports. With transparent, editable code for complete reproducibility, it's designed to accelerate scientific research workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 **No-Code Plotting & Analysis**
- Upload CSV/Excel data and generate publication-quality plots in clicks
- Line, scatter, bar, heatmap visualizations with labeled axes and legends
- Error bars (std, SEM, CI), regressions, and statistical tests
- AI-powered suggestions for analysis and visualization

### 🔬 **Image Analysis & Micrograph Processing**
- Calibrate image scale and select regions of interest (ROI)
- Extract edge profiles and compute roughness metrics
- FFT analysis to identify dominant frequencies and patterns
- Specialized tools for surface analysis and microscopy data

### 🧪 **Design of Experiments (DOE)**
- 2^n factorial designs (full and fractional)
- Randomization and blocking features
- Exportable factor/level tables for experiment execution
- Systematic approach to experimental design

### 📋 **FAIR Data Management**
- Metadata templates and README generators
- Data Management Plan (DMP) builders
- File naming conventions and organization helpers
- Export capabilities for reproducible workflows

### 🔒 **Privacy & Security**
- Data processed locally in your browser session
- No permanent data storage on servers
- Complete privacy and security for research data
- Export bundles generated on demand

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **📤 Upload** - CSV/Excel data or microscopy images
2. **💬 Describe** - Tell the AI what plot/metric/report you need
3. **💾 Export** - Get figures, tables, metadata, and reproducible code

## 🎯 Why Choose Plotivy?

- **⚡ Faster Results** - Describe outcomes; Plotivy drafts the analysis and renders figures you can fine-tune
- **🖼️ From Pixels to Metrics** - Extract quantitative data from images with calibrated measurements
- **🔒 Reproducible by Design** - Export the exact code behind every figure and table
- **📊 Publication Ready** - Generate figures that meet journal standards
- **🤖 AI-Assisted** - Get intelligent suggestions for analysis approaches
